# MediCall
Capstone project: app that shows the prescripted medicine that causes the giving side effect the user enters in the app.

I finally desided to go ahead and use JavaScript, Css, HTML and JSON to create the MediCall application.

I thought of creating a 'Mobile First' app, but on the other hand I thought to myself: "He, try to create a working webapplication first. You can better the application later on". 

I want the app to be clean, easy to use and userfriendly.

The idea is to push the code I am writing along the way to my Git repository.
